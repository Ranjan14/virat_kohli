                        I was the only player retained by the Royal Challengers franchise.
                        I was made captain of the team. when the regular skipper Daniel Vettori was injured,
                        The Royal Challengers coach Ray Jennings opined that the 22-year-old
                        would become the future captain of not only the franchise
                        but also the Indian team. At the 2016 IPL, the Royal Challengers finished runners-up and I
                        broke the record for most runs in an IPL season (of 733 runs) 
                        by scoring 973 runs in 16 matches at an average of 81.08, 
                        winning the Orange Cap as well as Most-valuable Player Award of Vivo IPL 2016 <br><br>

                        I'm usually bats at the no.3
                        position in ODI cricket.I bats with a slightly open-chested stance
                        and a strong bottom-hand grip,and is said to have quick footwork.
                        I'm known for my wide range of shots, ability to pace an innings
                        and batting under pressure.I'm strong through the mid-wicket and cover region.
                        I'm saying that the flick shot comes naturally to me. I does
                        not play the sweep shot often, 
                        being called "not a natural sweeper of the cricket ball.My 
                        teammates have praised his confidence, commitment, focus and work ethics.
                        I'm is also known to be a "sharp" fielder<br><br>

                        For the first Test of the 
                        Australian tour in December 2014, 
                        Dhoni was not part of the Indian team at Adelaide due to an injury, 
                        and I took the reins as Test captain for the first time. 
                        I scored 115 in India's first innings, 
                        becoming the fourth Indian to score a hundred on 
                        Test captaincy debut.In our second innings,
                        India were set a target of 364 to be scored on the fifth day.
                        I came in to bat when the Indian innings was reduced to 57/2 and 
                        started batting aggressively. <br><br>

                        India toured South Africa in December
                        2013 for three ODIs and two Tests. 
                        I averaged 15.50 in the ODIs, including a duck.
                        In the first Test at Johannesburg, playing my
                        first Test in South Africa and batting at 4 for the first time,
                        I scored 119 and 96. My hundred was the first by a 
                        subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998.
                        Regarding Kohli's hundred, South Africa bowling coach Allan Donald
                        said, "The one word that comes to my mind is responsibility. 
                        I think me showed great discipline and responsibility.<br><br>

                        I stood-in as the captain 
                        for the first ODI of the triangular series in the West Indies
                        after Dhoni injured himself during the match. 
                        India lost the match by one wicket, 
                        and Dhoni was subsequently ruled out of the series with me
                        being named the captain for the remaining matches.In my
                        second match as captain, I scored his first hundred as captain,
                        making 102 off 83 balls against the West Indies at
                        Port of Spain in a bonus point win for India.<br><br>
